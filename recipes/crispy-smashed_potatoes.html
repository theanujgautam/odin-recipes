    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crispy smashed potatoes are delicious, golden brown, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and these have an extra crispy layer of broiled Parmesan cheese on top. There are a few extra steps involved, but they are absolutely worth the effort.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (1 1/2 - to 2-inch) red skinned potatoes (12 to 16 small potatoes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>3 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely shredded (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan, and add enough water to cover by at least 1 inch. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes; drain</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Line a 15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil. Brush foil with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Transfer potatoes to the prepared baking pan. Use a wide-bottomed glass to lightly press down on each potato to smash to about 1/2-inch thickness, while keeping each potato in one piece.</li>
        <li>Brush smashed potatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven, uncovered, until bottoms are lightly browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn potatoes; sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Return to the oven and roast until potatoes are lightly browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Preheat the broiler and set a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over potatoes. </li>
        <li>Broil until cheese is golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
