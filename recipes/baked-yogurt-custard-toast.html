   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>
    For this baked yogurt custard toast, top French bread slices with a quickly-whisked yogurt and egg mixture and bake. It's that easy! The obvious comparison is to French toast, but the tangy, sweet yogurt custard topping makes these toasts more reminiscent of a cheese Danish.
   </p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li> tablespoons soft unsalted butter</li>

    <li>4 large, thick slices French bread</li>

    <li>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>

    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>

    <li>1 large egg</li>

    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Butter one side of bread, and place butter-side-down on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment.</li>
    <li>Whisk together yogurt, honey, vanilla extract, lemon zest, egg, and salt in a mixing bowl. Spoon custard mixture over bread, all the way to the edges, and pressing down lightly as you apply, to help the bread absorb as much as possible. Try to use all the custard</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, stir blueberries, strawberries, maple syrup, and lemon juice together in a bowl; set aside until needed.</li>
    <li>Serve custard toast immediately topped with fresh fruit.</li>
   </ol>
